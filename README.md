1.The driverpass project was developed for a client who needed a system that could efficiently connect learning drivers, instructors, and more. It tracked progress, took payments, has different driving packages, etc.
2.One thing I did well was creating UML diagrams to convey how parts of the system would work.
3.If I could choose one part to revise, it would be adding a way to convey easy scaling and the addition of new features for when the company requests them.
4.Intepreting the users needs involved a close look at all of their requirements, and implementing them well can more easily be done with user feedback. Personally I was working with a theoretical client but I tried to think about them as a real business who 
values efficiency and straightforwardness in a system.
5. When designing software, I take a thorough analysis of requirements so that I do not have to double back or recreate anything after is done incorrectly. I used the user stories to my advantage and tried to incorporate everything.
